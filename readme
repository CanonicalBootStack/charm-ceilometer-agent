Overview
--------

This charm provides the Ceilometer service for OpenStack.  It is intended to
be used alongside the other OpenStack components, starting with the Folsom
release.

Ceilometer is made up of 2 separate services: an API service, and a collector 
service. This charm allows them to be deployed in different
combination, depending on user preference and requirements.

This charm was developed to support deploying Folsom on both
Ubuntu Quantal and Ubuntu Precise.  Since Ceilometer is only available for
Ubuntu 12.04 via the Ubuntu Cloud Archive, deploying this charm to a
Precise machine will by default install Ceilometer and its dependencies from
the Cloud Archive.
